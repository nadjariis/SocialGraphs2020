                        Have you ever wondered how the artists of two different music genres might be connected? If so, you've come to the right place. 
                        This webpage provides an exploration of the Wikipedia pages of artists from the two genres "West Coast Hip Hop" and "Dance Pop", using links between 
                        the pages to create a network connecting all artists. This network contains several communities, which are further explored. 
                        The Wikipedia pages provide a large amount of text, allowing for text and sentiment analysis of artists as well as communites. 
                        By including lyrics from some of the songs associated with the artists, it is also possible to explore sentiments of lyrics and investigate 
                        how these sentiments change over time.

                    <p class="lead">
                        So how do you choose which two genres to explore? We aimed to select two genres that were somewhat connected, but simultaneously distinct 
                        enough to form clusters. Ultimately, it came down to selecting two genres that both contain artists that have (or have had) a noteworthy 
                        presence in the music business. That could be artists such as Beyoncé, Snoop Dogg and Madonna. Artists such as these will most likely be 
                        referenced by both artists from the same genre, and artists from the opposite genre. On the contrary, smaller artists will most likely 
                        mainly be referenced by artists from their own genre.

                        To get an overview of how our genres relate to each other, we have visualized the entire network. As seen from the visualization the 
                        two genres can be separated into clear clusters, which tells us that the Wikipedia pages of the artists generally refer to artists 
                        from the same genre, more often than they refer to artists from the other genre.

                    <p class="lead">
                      After removing isolated nodes (nodes with no connections) from our artist network, we are left with 595 nodes and 4247 edges that connect them. To get a better understanding
                      of the network, we can start by examining the number of edges that go into and out of each node. This is also called the degree of a node. In this case, the average degree is 
                      11.35, meaning that each node is on average connected to 11.35 other nodes. Let's dig a little deeper and make a degree distribution plot. 
                        <img src="images/DegreeDistribution.png" width="70%" class=center-image"> <br>
                      We observe that the degree distribution appears to follow a power law (approximately, at least) with many nodes having small degree and a few nodes having very large degree. 
                      This indicates that we are dealing with a scale-free network, which means that we expect the emergence of hubs in the network. A hub is simply a node with a number of connections that greatly exceeds the average [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hub_(network_science)). 
                      In this case, some hubs could be e.g. Snoop Dogg (degree 110) and Madonna (degree 67).

                      A network is said to have community structure if the nodes of the network can be grouped into sets of nodes, such that each set of nodes is densely connected internally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_structure">[1]</a>. 
                      With the use of specific algorithms we were able to find around 13 communities in our artist network. The five largest communities 
                      consist of more than 50 artists, while the rest of the communities consist of less than 17 artists. To get a sense of which artists are placed in which communities, we 
                      have listed ten of the artists **(er det dem med størst degree?)** in the five largest communities. 

                      Even without too much background knowledge on the two music genres, it is clear to see that the communities make somewhat sense. Community 1 contains a lot of the most notable
                      Dance Pop artists, while community 2 and 3 contain several notable West Coast Hip Hop artists. Aside from several rappers/hip-hop groups, Community 5 also contains the Dance Pop
                      band Gorillaz. This might seem odd at first, but Gorillaz actually collaborated with Del the Funky Homosapien, and thus both of those Wikipedia pages link to each other, which
                      might explain why Gorillaz was placed in community 5.

                      To get a better understanding of the communities, we have visualized them by drawing a network similar to the one we drew in the beginning, only this time with each node being
                      colored based on the community it belongs to. As seen from the visualization, there are five clearly distinguishable communities. This corresponds nicely with the fact that 
                      five of the communities we found are significantly larger than the rest. Most of the Dance Pop artists are placed in a single, large community, while the West Coast Hip Hop artists
                      are divided into four communities. One of these four communities appear to contain a few Dance Pop artists as well - presumabely Gorillaz, for example.
