                        Have you ever wondered how the artists of two different music genres might be connected? If so, you've come to the right place. 
                        This webpage provides an exploration of the Wikipedia pages of artists from the two genres "West Coast Hip Hop" and "Dance Pop", using links between 
                        the pages to create a network connecting all artists. This network contains several communities, which are further explored. 
                        The Wikipedia pages provide a large amount of text, allowing for text and sentiment analysis of artists as well as communites. 
                        By including lyrics from some of the songs associated with the artists, it is also possible to explore sentiments of lyrics and investigate 
                        how these sentiments change over time.

                    <p class="lead">
                        So how do you choose which two genres to explore? We aimed to select two genres that were somewhat connected, but simultaneously distinct 
                        enough to form clusters. Ultimately, it came down to selecting two genres that both contain artists that have (or have had) a noteworthy 
                        presence in the music business. That could be artists such as Beyoncé, Snoop Dogg and Madonna. Artists such as these will most likely be 
                        referenced by both artists from the same genre, and artists from the opposite genre. On the contrary, smaller artists will most likely 
                        mainly be referenced by artists from their own genre.

                        To get an overview of how our genres relate to each other, we have visualized the entire network. As seen from the visualization the 
                        two genres can be separated into clear clusters, which tells us that the Wikipedia pages of the artists generally refer to artists 
                        from the same genre, more often than they refer to artists from the other genre.

                    <p class="lead">
                      After removing isolated nodes (nodes with no connections) from our artist network, we are left with 595 nodes and 4247 edges that connect them. To get a better understanding
                      of the network, we can start by examining the number of edges that go into and out of each node. This is also called the degree of a node. In this case, the average degree is 
                      11.35, meaning that each node is on average connected to 11.35 other nodes. Let's dig a little deeper and make a degree distribution plot. 
                    </p>    
                    <div>
                      <img src="images/DegreeDistribution.png" width="70%" class="center-image">
                    </div>
                    <p class="lead">
                      We observe that the degree distribution appears to follow a power law (approximately, at least) with many nodes having small degree and a few nodes having very large degree. 
                      This indicates that we are dealing with a scale-free network, which means that we expect the emergence of hubs in the network. A hub is simply a node with a number of connections that greatly exceeds the average <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hub_(network_science)">[2]</a>. 
                      In this case, some hubs could be e.g. Snoop Dogg and Madonna. 
                      <br>
                      Now that we know a little more about the nodes in the network, let's take a closer look at a section of the network. Knowing the average degree to be 11.35,
                      we choose to look at only the nodes with degree larger than 15. Below is a visualization containing only these nodes
                      and their connections. Please note that since all nodes with degree less than 15 have been removed, some nodes appear to have quite few connections in this network, 
                      even though they have at least 15 connections in the full network.
                    </p>

                      <object class="ob" data="_includes/graph_output.html" width="100%" height="825px"></object>

                    <p class="lead">
                      The purple nodes are Dance Pop artists, while the blue nodes are West Coast Hip Hop artists. The single green node
                      belongs to both genres. The node size depends on the degree of the node, which explains why e.g. the Snoop Dogg node is so large. Please notice
                      that the network is interactive, which allows for both zooming and dragging. Furthermore, hovering over a node lists the
                      neighbours of the giving node while clicking a node higlights its connections.
                      <br> 
                      The visualization clearly illustrates the hub-structure in the network, with some notable hubs being e.g. Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Madonna. An interesting difference between 
                      these nodes is that Snoop Dogg appears to be connected to quite a few Dance-Pop artists, while Madonna is connected to few West Coast Hip Hop artists.

                    <p class="lead">
                      A network is said to have community structure if the nodes of the network can be grouped into sets of nodes, such that each set of nodes is densely connected internally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_structure">[1]</a>. 
                      With the use of specific algorithms we were able to find around 13 communities in our artist network. The five largest communities 
                      consist of more than 50 artists, while the rest of the communities consist of less than 17 artists. To get a sense of which artists are placed in which communities, we 
                      have listed the ten artists with largest degree, from each of the five largest communities. 
                      <br>
                      Even without too much background knowledge on the two music genres, it is clear to see that the communities make somewhat sense. Community 1 contains a lot of the most notable
                      Dance Pop artists, while community 2 and 3 contain several notable West Coast Hip Hop artists. Aside from several rappers/hip-hop groups, Community 5 also contains the Dance Pop
                      band Gorillaz. This might seem odd at first, but Gorillaz actually collaborated with Del the Funky Homosapien, and thus both of those Wikipedia pages link to each other, which
                      might explain why Gorillaz was placed in community 5.

                      To get a better understanding of the communities, we have visualized them by drawing a network similar to the one we drew in the beginning, only this time with each node being
                      colored based on the community it belongs to. As seen from the visualization, there are five clearly distinguishable communities. This corresponds nicely with the fact that 
                      five of the communities we found are significantly larger than the rest. Most of the Dance Pop artists are placed in a single, large community, while the West Coast Hip Hop artists
                      are divided into four communities. One of these four communities appear to contain a few Dance Pop artists as well - presumabely Gorillaz, for example.

                    <p class="lead"> 
                      Now that we've seen that the genres can be clearly separated into two large clusters, it would be interesting to
                      investigate whether there are some words that are typical for the genres. One way to investigate this would be to make wordclouds, which are simply visualizations consisting of
                      free-floating words, where the size of the words indicate their relevance. Since we have a bunch of text from the
                      Wikipedia pages, we can easily make a corpus for each genre, containing all the text from the artists belonging to the 
                      given genre. The relevance of each word can then be determined by the use of a modified version of TF-IDF, which is described in-depth in the Explainer Notebook. 
                      Below are two wordclouds; one for each genre.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">

                    <p class="lead"> 
                      Without looking at the titles above the plots, it's easy to see which wordcloud belongs to which genre. The most prominent words in theDance-Pop wordcloud are "Selena", 
                      "Minogue" and "Cher". These artists (Selena Gomez, Kylie Minogue and Cher) are all noteworthy musicians, and so it makes sense that they have contributed to defining the genre.
                      Other genre-defining artists such as Lady Gaga and Rihanna are also present in the wordcloud, but as a consequence of the way the relevancy of each word was calculated, these 
                      words appear less relevant. The relevancy of each word is "weighted", meaning that a word is deemed more relevant for the genre if it appears mostly in the given genre, and not
                      in the other genre. This implies that artists such as Selena Gomez and Kylie Minogue are very specific to the Dance-Pop genre, whereas e.g. Rihanna appears in both genres, and 
                      is therefore not especially typical for the Dance-Pop genre.

                      For the West Coast wordcloud, the most prominent words appear to be "Hussle" and "Hopsin". As with the Dance-Pop artists, we can infer that these two artists must be especially
                      typical for West Coast Hip Hop.

                      if they have linked to other artist on their wikipage or are mentioned on other artist
                      wikipages. When an artist is mentioned it's often caused by collaceration between the 
                      two artist or they have in otherways been working together. Since we wanted to find artist 
                      which defines where genre, but also works accros genres, the degrees where calculated using the 
                      full network.</p>

                    <p class="lead">
                      First, lets take a look at the defining artist in Dance Pop and the words which defines there music. 
                      The artist in Dance Pop with highest degree (booth in- and out-degrees) are Britney Spears 90, Madonna 87, 
                      Rihanna 76, Nicki Minaj 61 and Janet Jackson 59. he most defining words for this genre is love, boy, dream, 
                      life and God to just name a few. The charactics is the positive wording  and the lyrics is defined by the fact 
                      that most song is about big themes like love, dreams and God. This aligns well its with the sentiment of the lyrics, 
                      where all top 5 artist is above 5.5 except Nicki Minaj. If we take a close look at her and the artists she has collaberated
                      with, she has worked with a number of West Coast Hiphop artist aswell as Dance Pop artist. She is well known for her 
                      rapping skills, and the more hardcore language and word bombs is therefor a hugh part of her WordCloud and sentiment score.</p>
